# datacollection-challenge

### Project Description
 - This assignment uses Data Collection techniques learned in class to obtian Mars data from a given website. Jupyter Notebook and Python were used to scrap data from the website and give the information that was asked for.
### Summary of Contents
 - Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
     - Automated browsing with Splinter was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted with Beautiful Soup
     - The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted
     - The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure
 - Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
     - The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame
     - The data was analyzed to answer, "How many months exist on Mars?", and "How many Martian days' worth of data are there?"
     - The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, "Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?", "Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?" and, "How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?". Then a data visualization was created to support each answer
     - The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file
